# The Story of GABS

Around the year 2000, I started learning web development as a self-taught developer — books, CD-Roms, and gradually the first online tutorials that were beginning to appear on the internet. HTML first, then PHP very quickly, driven by the obvious need to manage content dynamically.

Between 2008 and 2010, I built my first real projects: modest websites for family and friends, then for small businesses that wanted to present their products or services online. That's where I truly felt the pain of mixing PHP and HTML: code that quickly became unreadable, hard to maintain, and where the slightest design tweak risked breaking the business logic.

I looked for existing solutions — template engines suited to these "small" projects — but none of them really worked for me. Too complex, too heavy, too far from the way I liked to work.

So I decided to build one myself.

That first template engine was called [**QuickModels**](http://fredomkb.free.fr/quickmodels/index.php) *(project still accessible online, but which has not been maintained or modernized for a long time)*. It worked, I used it on several sites, but I soon noticed that half its features had never been used — and that its syntax, based on tags hidden inside HTML comments, was becoming tedious to work with day to day.

So I started over from scratch, with a much stronger guiding principle: **"logic-less"**. Remove all business logic from templates entirely. PHP prepares the data, HTML displays it — full stop. A radical separation, but surprisingly enjoyable once you master the approach.

The first versions of **GABS** were born from that conviction. I used them on several real sites and immediately appreciated the clarity this approach brought to template work.

Then the project sat in a drawer… until 2025.

That year, I needed a lightweight template engine again for a new project. I looked at what was available in the PHP ecosystem — popular solutions had evolved, some had become the standard, but they remained clearly oversized for my needs. I thought of **GABS**, dusted it off, and decided to modernise it.

To get a fresh and objective perspective on the code, I turned to several AI agents — Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Perplexity and Mistral. Their analyses surprised me with their relevance: improvement suggestions, new features, fundamental fixes. I hadn't expected that level of feedback, and it gave me the motivation to take the project seriously again.

Starting from version v0112, I worked closely with these agents to make **GABS** more flexible and robust. By v0118, the result felt solid enough to share — so I published the project on GitHub.

One important thing to mention: while the AI agents contributed a great deal, I never simply copy-pasted their suggestions. Every idea was read, understood and adapted to my way of coding. What mattered most to me was learning and mastering every aspect of how **GABS** works — not just getting a result.

Today, at version v0120, **GABS** is a deliberately simple template engine: lightweight, fast, easy to install and easy to learn. It covers the needs of modest projects — showcase sites, landing pages, portfolios, blogs, product and service presentations, etc. — in situations where a modern full-featured engine would be frankly excessive.

**GABS** it's not a universal solution. **It's the right solution for the right projects.**

*Happy building!*
